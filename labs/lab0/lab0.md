## Reflection
1. What aspect of the lab did you find to be the hardest? <br>
```This wasn't so hard for me but I struglled to set up debug envrionment on codespace. I havren't set it up yet as the first task didn't require a lot of coding, but I will have to figure it out how for next lab.```<br><br>
2. What do you think about CodeSpaces? What did you like/not like about Codespaces? <br>
```I really like the idea that I'm able to edit on browser and send it to remote repo directly. One of the cons migth be that I can't select IDEs that I want, but VSCode is a very powerful tool and popular in many different languages. So I can't complain much at the moment. ```
